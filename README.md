# node-bootstrap

A highly opinionated bootstrap for node.js project by [Tony Lukasavage](https://twitter.com/tonylukasavage). While this can be used for any node.js project, my focus has been primarily on tooling and CLI.

## Install

```bash
$ npm install -g node-bootstrap
```

## Usage

```bash
$ node-boostrap PROJECT_NAME --dest /path/to/new_project
```
